## Project Goals

**RESTAPI-SoccorsoWeb** aims to provide concrete examples, tools, and reusable components for building web applications, integrating both frontend and backend technologies. The project is:

- **A starting point** for those who want to learn the basics and best practices of web technologies.
- **A lab** to experiment with frameworks, libraries, and modern methodologies.
- **A collection of templates and utilities** ready to speed up the development cycle.

---

## Key Features

- **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable and easily extendable modules.
- **Full Stack**: Integration of frontend code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and backend (Java).
- **Practical examples**: Guides, snippets, and sample projects for hands-on learning.
- **Detailed documentation**: Each component and feature comes with technical descriptions and usage examples.
- **Compatibility**: Focus on cross-browser support and compatibility with major operating systems.
